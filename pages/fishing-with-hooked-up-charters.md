### Making the most out of your day with us

The day of fishing with Hooked Up Charters begins with an early start. Our start time depends on the tides and currents, but we like to get out there early to make the most out of your day. After a short initial cruise, we get out there and find the perfect spots to fish.

### Sit back and relax

Spend the day trolling for salmon and jigging for ling cod, red snapper and other rockfish, while taking in the fresh ocean air. While on board, we’ll share stories, jokes and laughter, as well as refreshments and snacks as the relaxing day passes by…

After a successful day of fishing, we’ll coast back along the scenic route into Pender Harbour. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for local wildlife—animal and bird watchers will enjoy this portion of the day, as the Sunshine Coast is rich with life. Upon return, we’ll will clean and bag your catch, conveniently preparing it for travel.
